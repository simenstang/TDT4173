This guide is about how to make a virtual environment. Having a virtual environment is cruical for such a project. A virutal enviornment can be described as follows,

"A virtual environment is like a separate bubble for your Python projects, keeping their libraries and tools from mixing and causing problems with each other or your computer's main setup."

To setup a virtual environment perform the following command.

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

To activate the virtual environment run the following command. 

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
You'll see the virtual environment's name in your command prompt, indicating that it's activated.

The project has a requirments.txt. All our dependecies will reside there. To install all the necessary dependenices perform the following comand.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
